# CollaborationKit

[CollaborationKit](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Extension:CollaborationKit) is a MediaWiki extension for building on-wiki workspaces, including WikiProjects and edit-a-thons.

Features include:

* Easy-to-use forms for creating and editing collaborative workspaces.
* One-click sign-up for projects, including a member list that automatically sorts active and inactive members.
* New functionality to build lists of articles to work on and selectively transclude them on other pages.

CollaborationKit introduces two new types of pages:

* Collaboration Hubs, which are workspaces representing a project and include tasks to work on.
* Collaboration Lists, which are structured lists of pages to work on. These pages separate the content from its presentation, making it easier for bots to update the page and allowing us to build specialized editing interfaces not feasible with traditional wiki pages. That said, they can still be moved, deleted, etc. like regular pages.
